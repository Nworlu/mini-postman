# 📨 Mini Postman Clone (React + Vite, No Backend)

This is a lightweight Postman-style tool built with **React** and **Vite**. It allows you to create, send, and store mock HTTP requests — all within your browser using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- Send mock HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
- Save request history using `localStorage`
- Edit, delete, and re-use requests
- Built with React + Vite for fast performance
- 100% frontend — no backend or APIs required

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- JavaScript / TypeScript (optional)
- LocalStorage for persistence

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, in-browser tool to quickly test and store request templates without any server setup. This also served as a fun exercise to deepen my understanding of local storage and state management in React.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the repo and start the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-postman-clone.git
cd mini-postman-clone
npm install
npm run dev
```
